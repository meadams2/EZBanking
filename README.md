# SynergyBank - A Banking Software

The goal of this project is to create a banking software with two separate user interfaces for the administrator and the customer. As with any bank, there are multiple administrators and multiple customers. 

# Use Case

There are two different users within this program: the administrator and the customer. 
- The administrator will have access to login, add customers, manage customer accounts, change their PIN, and apply interest.
- The customer will have access to login, deposit and/or withdrawal money from their account(s), and change their PIN.
